Bees have a mutualistic relationship with their context, live in communal hives with lots of social interaction but also have individual specific tasks related to their age. Beehives are formed in an instinctively optimized way, by creating the most efficient routes, adapting to wind orientation and other factors. Just like the bees, the building has a mutualistic relationship with its context, as the context is to benefit from the placement of the building and the building is a response to the context. The building is communal with the possibility of lots of social interaction, but also the possibility to seclude from the community. The people in our building help each other with specific tasks related to their age. Young people can help elderly with grocery shopping, and the elderly can help the young people with life advice. Just like the beehive, our building is formed in an optimized way. Other than the beehive, in this case it\u2019s done with the usage of scripts. This is a project repository of Minor Spatial Computing 2020-2021, project group 1. The mid-term and Final submission's process, final products and underlying code/input can be found in this repository. The design challenge We as Project Apidae are requested to design a housing complex incorporating severalcommunal/public facilities for a cooperative live-work-playassociation at location \"Rotterdam, The block betweenVijverhofstraat, Zomerhofstraat, Schoterbosstraat, and Teilingerstraat\". The requested housing complex will be the new home of garduate students, young professionals and elderly who are in need of assisted living. The complex has to provide communal and public facilities to ensure collectivity. Starting point The following program of requirements has been given: Housing: * Student Housing 80 units * Assisted Living 30 units * Starter Housing 100 units * testing spaces Communal spaces: * Underground Parking (minimum of 0.5 parking lots per * apartment) * Vegetation (minimum 30% of the plot) * Workshops/Fab-Labs/Co-working Space and Start-up Offices * Library + Cinematheque + Caf\u00e9/Pub + (pinball) Arcade * Co-cooking/Restaurant * Community Centre * Shop (grocery, tools and crafts) * (electricity producing/odourless /geek-friendly) Gym Also, the following design goals have been given: * Maximum Multi-scale Modularity (Qualitative) * Excellent Ergonomics (Qualitative) * Keeping at least the same amount of housing units as before (Quantitative) * Not blocking direct light for neighbour buildings (Quantitative) * Max solar gain potential (optional, Quantitative) * Max greenery (Quantitative) * Min noise (Quantitative) * Social integration (Qualitative) * Rational spectra of privacy and community (Qualitative) Why Apidae? As architecture students we often do things for a reason, without even knowing whether it will actually work. We would design our building in a certain shape, to maximize the amount of sunlight coming into the building, but without any scientific evidence. Besides that, the architecture world is quite conservative. Change, no matter the improvement, takes a long time to be accepted. At the same time, the construction industry is worldwide responsible for 40% of the C02-emission [Source] . A change in the way we design and form our buildings is necessary. This is where the apidae method comes into play. The apidae method scientifically substantiates design choices, makes the process more efficient and modular, while still giving the designer enough room for subjective choices. Phasing The documentation is divided in 4 phases: * A1_Planning: Preliminary spatial analysis on the site and idea proposal (KPI, Program of Requirements, Diagrams) with the starting point as input. * A2_Configuring: Setting up the plot, determining voxel size * A3_Massing: All the * A4_Forming: Shafts and corridors, Multi criteria, Polygonization Saving this for later\"; <div style= \"line-height:150%;\" > <br> </div>","title":"Home"},{"location":"#the-design-challenge","text":"We as Project Apidae are requested to design a housing complex incorporating severalcommunal/public facilities for a cooperative live-work-playassociation at location \"Rotterdam, The block betweenVijverhofstraat, Zomerhofstraat, Schoterbosstraat, and Teilingerstraat\".

With keeping privacy in mind, the collectivity will provide a better housing situation and a stronger social connection for every inhabitant. The green of the building and surroundings will contribute to a better and resilient neighbourhood. The energy-neutral building in combination with the green and sustainable design will be ready for the future and will form an example and a benchmark for other buildings. User Experience Students The live-work-play co\u00f6perative forms a home basis for the students, where they are not only living with other students, but where they find collective spaces with many extra possibilities. They can make use of the co-cooking kitchen to invite friends and family over and enjoy all the other facilities provided in this building, like the gym and the co-working spaces. The mix with other users gives the student the opportunity to get a discount on their rent by spending time with and helping the elderly and by babysitting the children of the starters. To make this work, a bulletin board is central in the community centre, where people can ask for and give help, products or even leftovers. The community centre forms a place to connect with other users, but also provides a lounge space where they can relax and enjoy a drink, read a book or have friends over. Elderly The elderly in the building will have all the privacy they need, and will not experience any nuisance from the students or starters. By grouping the elderly homes not only nuisance is battled, this is also efficient for elderly support, and to boost the interaction between elderly. This is done by providing coffee spaces near the apartments. Besides the privacy and tranquility in the area of the houses for elderly there are many options to stay active and be in touch with other user groups and externals. The community centre provides many entertainment options for them, and gives them a chance to interact with others. The students can help the elderly with daily tasks and do social activities. This way social isolation is being battled. Starters The starters in this building finished their education and started to work. After a hard day at work the inhabitants enter the building without going through the collective spaces, straight to their homes. If they are in a relationship and/or having kids they will most of the time cook their own dinner. When alone or sometimes do not want to cook they choose to make use of the co-cooking space in the collective area. The dwellings of the starters are big enough to expand the household and have room for teleworking. Therefore the dwellings are well sound isolated and contribute to the privacy of the inhabitants. The starters can do anything in their home with keeping their privacy, but when they need social contact or longing back to their student life they go to the community centre or the bar for seeing a movie or socializing with others. While the starters are busy with their career and family, they could still help in the buildings\u2019 household activities, like helping the elderly, cooking for people or doing activities. The building gives starters the opportunities to work near their home with office workspaces, fab labs and other working rooms. Therefore combining family-life and working will be a nice experience. Still, the majority of the people will work somewhere else. For them, students and elderly can help the starters by providing day care for the children they might have. Externals By adding this building to the neighbourhood, the area gets more lively and all the shops and restaurants will get an economic boost. Thereby, the overall quality of the area can improve and it gets more interesting to go there. A second improvement where externals profit from, is the addition of greenery in the scene. These greenspaces will make the place less rough and gives it even more the reason to go there and enjoy the lively neighbourhood. Key Performance Indicators Collectivity Connect all residents by creating collective (indoor and outdoor) spaces, providing an inclusive living environment. Give the different target groups the option to mix together, but also be able to seclude from each other to have the perks of living together, but not the disadvantages.

Since after discussion we decided to enlarge the floor height. First approach Y dimension Option Based on stair option x/y/z sizes Comment Option 1 Option 3 120 / 510 / 306 510 is quite a big size, but there\u2019s no division possible which leads to an integer multitude of 6. So this will not be a good voxel size. Option 2 Option 4 126 / 486 / 306 -> 126 / 162 / 306 To make it fitting for human dimensions let\u2019s divide the the y value by 3. The stairs which we calculated earlier will now be 3 voxels. Option 3 Option 5 120 / 408 / 306 -> 120 / 102 / 306 The previous voxels will be sufficient for a building with the same height everywhere, but the z value is too big to differ in height through the building.

We have decided after consultation with our tutors to take the same dimension for the x and y value of the voxel. For the definitive approach towards the voxel size we will use the option for stair dimensions we previously used, since the size was thoroughly thought about in the first approach. Apart from this, as a project group we decided it would be a pragmatic approach to decide our tartan grid based on the thickness of the support structure the building will be made of, to make it fit into the tartan grid. For this, we made a rough estimation of the area of our building through the Program of Requirements, and how this relates to the available area for our building (obtained through measurements in ArcGIS), we came to a rough estimate of 3 stories, if the available area is maximised, in other words: if all the spaces are summed up. Since we have to take into account the varying height in the building, we decided to look at surrounding buildings in the area and the width of the streets and decided upon a maximum of 10 stories high. We estimated that we would need a SHS-HF-300 profile for this height. We chose this profile because it has the same x as y value and based our voxel grid on this. Although these dimensions (300x300) are workable, the size is really small and not really algorithm friendly because the building would consist of too many voxels because of the building site's size. So let\u2019s take the 300x300 voxels as our meso voxels for the tartan grid. If we go back to the stair dimensions which were previously researched and have chosen the following can be said: Rise= 18cm (3x6), 306/18 = 17 steps, tread width= 30cm (5x6), length stairs= 17x30 = 510cm, width staircase= 120cm (20x6) With a stair width of 120cm we could make our voxel size based on 120cm+ meso voxel. But to be on the safe side, and taken into account the railings of the stairs it\u2019s better to take an extra meso voxel for the voxel size. So the voxel size will be 150cm + mesovoxel = 180cm. The tartan grid is the place where the structural profiles or the walls can come. Space criteria In order to meet the desired quality as stated in A1_Planning and given through a Program of Requirements, criteria have been set for spaces.

Once that worked we splitted the interpolation, because that calculation takes more time, so to protect our modest hardware, we thought it would be better to split them up. Lowres size decisions when first running our interpolated shadow file, we used a low res envelope which was only 2 voxels high. This resulted in the shadow casting calculation becoming much to generalized. In this situation it would calculate the entire bottom half of the building as not casting shadow on the neighbouring buildings, thus not showing them in the shadow casting and only showing the top half of the building in the visualisation. To solve this problem we changed the low res envelope from being 2 voxels, to being 3 voxels high. This resulted in a visualisation of the entire ennvelope. difference between shadow and solar The result of our interpolated shadow envelope and the interpolated solar envelope, are both processed in a different way. Fundamentaly we want our building to be of least disturbance for the surrounding area, so it wouldn't make sense to keep voxles which cast too much shadow. This is why we remove the voxels which cast too much shadow on the surrounding areas. The solar value of each voxel however, you could argue that for the sake of the building, it would be best too only keep the voxels which have optimal sun access. However, this would result in removing the voxels on the ground level. We want to have functions on the lower level, and pathwise it wouldn't make sense as well to remove (almost) all voxels on the ground level. Besides that, in the growth script for our different rooms, the room types that want to have a lot of sun access, will automatically grow towards the voxels which have optimal sun access. Threshold For our treshold value we chose 0.4. Every voxel that in more than 40% of the time it recieves sun, casts a shadow on the surrounding area, is removed.

Create documentation environment Now we need to create the appropriate environment for documenting by installing all the necessary tools. To do so we have provided you an environment droplet, which is a recipe for a series of installations that create the aforementioned environment. For that, after directing to the root folder of this project where the environment droplet ( environment.yml ) is located, you need to run the following command: conda env create -f environment.yml Start Work on Documentation After finishing your work on documentation you need to shutdown the server and deactivate the environment. Activate the Environment Now that you have created the appropriate environment, you need to activate the environment to be able to work inside it. For that, as you are in the root folder of this project, you need to run the following command: conda activate spatial_computing_docs If the command line is now indicating the name of the environment in paranthesis, it means that the environment is activated. Similar to this ( spatial_computing_docs ) { your username } @ { your computer name } spatial_computing_project_template % Run the Local Server Now that the environment is activated, we need to run the local server to be able to see the result of changes in the local version of the documentation website. For that, run the following command: mkdocs serve After running this command, if the server has started to work successfully, you should see the following line in the command line: INFO - Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000 This means that the server is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000 . If you open your browser and go this link you should see a local version of the site. Writing Your Documentation In the documenting process you need to head to the docs folder and edit the .md (markdown) files, since the website is build from these files. In the root of this project, you can edit the configurations of your project in mkdocs.yml file: Adding o removing pages Add markdown extensions . Some of the useful extensions: arithmatex for writing mathematics highlight for code highlighting Customizing the looks of your documentation Adding MkDocs Plugins , such as: mknotebooks for including python notebooks in the documentations Finish Work on Documentation Server Shut Down To shutdown the server, you need to press Ctrl + C in the command line. The following should appear in the command line: INFO - Shutting down... Deactivate Environment After shutting down your server the command line is back to the normal state and you can run commands again. To deactivate your environment you need to run the following command: conda deactivate Deployment of the Documentation Site Build and Deploy to deploy your documentation website, you need to run the following command in the root of this repository: mkdocs gh-deploy This command will create a new branch in your repository called gh-pages and build your site in it. It will then push the new branch to your remote repository automatically. It will also create a site folder in your root directory containing all of your site files. Since this folder is added .gitignore file, it won't be committed or pushed to the remote repository. Setup GitHub Pages For the first time, you need to configure the GitHub Pages service on your GitHub repository so it wil automatically build your documentation website whenever you deploy your site. To do this: Go to your repository setting, got GitHub Pages section, select gh-pages branch, select /(root) location, click on the save button.
