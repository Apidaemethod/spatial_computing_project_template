They can make use of the co-cooking kitchen to invite friends and family over and enjoy all the other facilities provided in this building, like the gym and the co-working spaces. The mix with other users gives the student the opportunity to get a discount on their rent by spending time with and helping the elderly and by babysitting the children of the starters. To make this work, a bulletin board is central in the community centre, where people can ask for and give help, products or even leftovers. The community centre forms a place to connect with other users, but also provides a lounge space where they can relax and enjoy a drink, read a book or have friends over. Elderly The elderly in the building will have all the privacy they need, and will not experience any nuisance from the students or starters. By grouping the elderly homes not only nuisance is battled, this is also efficient for elderly support, and to boost the interaction between elderly. This is done by providing coffee spaces near the apartments. Besides the privacy and tranquility in the area of the houses for elderly there are many options to stay active and be in touch with other user groups and externals. The community centre provides many entertainment options for them, and gives them a chance to interact with others. The students can help the elderly with daily tasks and do social activities. This way social isolation is being battled. Starters The starters in this building finished their education and started to work. After a hard day at work the inhabitants enter the building without going through the collective spaces, straight to their homes. If they are in a relationship and/or having kids they will most of the time cook their own dinner. When alone or sometimes do not want to cook they choose to make use of the co-cooking space in the collective area. The dwellings of the starters are big enough to expand the household and have room for teleworking. Therefore the dwellings are well sound isolated and contribute to the privacy of the inhabitants. The starters can do anything in their home with keeping their privacy, but when they need social contact or longing back to their student life they go to the community centre or the bar for seeing a movie or socializing with others. While the starters are busy with their career and family, they could still help in the buildings\u2019 household activities, like helping the elderly, cooking for people or doing activities. The building gives starters the opportunities to work near their home with office workspaces, fab labs and other working rooms. Therefore combining family-life and working will be a nice experience. Still, the majority of the people will work somewhere else. For them, students and elderly can help the starters by providing day care for the children they might have. Externals By adding this building to the neighbourhood, the area gets more lively and all the shops and restaurants will get an economic boost. Thereby, the overall quality of the area can improve and it gets more interesting to go there. A second improvement where externals profit from, is the addition of greenery in the scene. These greenspaces will make the place less rough and gives it even more the reason to go there and enjoy the lively neighbourhood.

Procedure Construct a voxelated model of the site with a maximum height of 100 meters. Orient the voxel grid to a global coordinate system (e.g. geographical North-East-West-South). Size the voxels carefully based on the modular height of steps and the length of stair flights and ramps so that they fit in X/Y directions into multiple pixels. Choose the Z size of voxels according to step risers and choose the same size for X and Y as a whole multiple of step threads. There are three types of spaces in terms of pedestrian movement in buildings, metaphorically speaking, spaces to walk through (e.g. corridors, ramps, and stairs), spaces to stand on (e.g. platforms connecting doors to corridors and stairs) and spaces to sit on (functional rooms/spaces). Construct a simplified mesh model of all bridges (corridors, ramps, stairs) connected by standing platforms in a modular grid of voxels/pixels. Take into account the free-height necessary for all spaces and pack them into the bounding volume of the building.

Procedure Construct a voxelated model of the site with a maximum height of 100 meters. Orient the voxel grid to a global coordinate system (e.g. geographical North-East-West-South). Size the voxels carefully based on the modular height of steps and the length of stair flights and ramps so that they fit in X/Y directions into multiple pixels. Choose the Z size of voxels according to step risers and choose the same size for X and Y as a whole multiple of step threads.

Create documentation environment Now we need to create the appropriate environment for documenting by installing all the necessary tools. To do so we have provided you an environment droplet, which is a recipe for a series of installations that create the aforementioned environment. For that, after directing to the root folder of this project where the environment droplet ( environment.yml ) is located, you need to run the following command: conda env create -f environment.yml Start Work on Documentation After finishing your work on documentation you need to shutdown the server and deactivate the environment. Activate the Environment Now that you have created the appropriate environment, you need to activate the environment to be able to work inside it. For that, as you are in the root folder of this project, you need to run the following command: conda activate spatial_computing_docs If the command line is now indicating the name of the environment in paranthesis, it means that the environment is activated. Similar to this ( spatial_computing_docs ) { your username } @ { your computer name } spatial_computing_project_template % Run the Local Server Now that the environment is activated, we need to run the local server to be able to see the result of changes in the local version of the documentation website. For that, run the following command: mkdocs serve After running this command, if the server has started to work successfully, you should see the following line in the command line: INFO - Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000 This means that the server is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000 . If you open your browser and go this link you should see a local version of the site. Writing Your Documentation In the documenting process you need to head to the docs folder and edit the .md (markdown) files, since the website is build from these files. In the root of this project, you can edit the configurations of your project in mkdocs.yml file: Adding o removing pages Add markdown extensions . Some of the useful extensions: arithmatex for writing mathematics highlight for code highlighting Customizing the looks of your documentation Adding MkDocs Plugins , such as: mknotebooks for including python notebooks in the documentations Finish Work on Documentation Server Shut Down To shutdown the server, you need to press Ctrl + C in the command line. The following should appear in the command line: INFO - Shutting down... Deactivate Environment After shutting down your server the command line is back to the normal state and you can run commands again. To deactivate your environment you need to run the following command: conda deactivate Deployment of the Documentation Site Build and Deploy to deploy your documentation website, you need to run the following command in the root of this repository: mkdocs gh-deploy This command will create a new branch in your repository called gh-pages and build your site in it. It will then push the new branch to your remote repository automatically. It will also create a site folder in your root directory containing all of your site files. Since this folder is added .gitignore file, it won't be committed or pushed to the remote repository. Setup GitHub Pages For the first time, you need to configure the GitHub Pages service on your GitHub repository so it wil automatically build your documentation website whenever you deploy your site. To do this: Go to your repository setting, got GitHub Pages section, select gh-pages branch, select /(root) location, click on the save button.
