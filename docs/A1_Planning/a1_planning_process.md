## Building identity
The building exploits the benefits of collectivity as much as possible while limiting its disadvantages. With keeping privacy in mind, the collectivity will provide a better housing situation and a stronger social connection for every inhabitant. The green of the building and surroundings will contribute to a better and resilient neighbourhood. The energy-neutral building in combination with the green and sustainable design will be ready for the future and will form an example and a benchmark for other buildings.

## User Experience
### **Students**
The live-work-play coöperative forms a home basis for the students, where they are not only living with other students, but where they find collective spaces with many extra possibilities. They can make use of the co-cooking kitchen to invite friends and family over and enjoy all the other facilities provided in this building, like the gym and the co-working spaces. The mix with other users gives the student the opportunity to get a discount on their rent by spending time with and helping the elderly and by babysitting the children of the starters. To make this work, a bulletin board is central in the community centre, where people can ask for and give help, products or even leftovers. The community centre forms a place to connect with other users, but also provides a lounge space where they can relax and enjoy a drink, read a book or have friends over. 


### **Elderly**
The elderly in the building will have all the privacy they need, and will not experience any nuisance from the students or starters. By grouping the elderly homes not only nuisance is battled, this is also efficient for elderly support, and to boost the interaction between elderly. This is done by providing coffee spaces near the apartments. Besides the privacy and tranquility in the area of the houses for elderly there are many options to stay active and be in touch with other user groups and externals. The community centre provides many entertainment options for them, and gives them a chance to interact with others. The students can help the elderly with daily tasks and do social activities. This way social isolation is being battled.


### **Starters**
The starters in this building finished their education and started to work. After a hard day at work the inhabitants enter the building without going through the collective spaces, straight to their homes. If they are in a relationship and/or having kids they will most of the time cook their own dinner. When alone or sometimes do not want to cook they choose to make use of the co-cooking space in the collective area. The dwellings of the starters are big enough to expand the household and have room for teleworking. Therefore the dwellings are well sound isolated and contribute to the privacy of the inhabitants. The starters can do anything in their home with keeping their privacy, but when they need social contact or longing back to their student life they go to the community centre or the bar for seeing a movie or socializing with others. While the starters are busy with their career and family, they could still help in the buildings’ household activities, like helping the elderly, cooking for people or doing activities. 
The building gives starters the opportunities to work near their home with office workspaces, fab labs and other working rooms. Therefore combining family-life and working will be a nice experience. Still, the majority of the people will work somewhere else. For them, students and elderly can help the starters by providing day care for the children they might have.


### **Externals**
By adding this building to the neighbourhood, the area gets more lively and all the shops and restaurants will get an economic boost. Thereby, the overall quality of the area can improve and it gets more interesting to go there. A second improvement where externals profit from, is the addition of greenery in the scene. These greenspaces will make the place less rough and gives it even more the reason to go there and enjoy the lively neighbourhood.
