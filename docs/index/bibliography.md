Cooking in pairs (or more?); if full time used: 160 = 80 pairs. Assuming cooking around 16:00-20:00, 1 hour each pair: 80/4 = 20cooking units needed.
per co-cooking unit 6m2 * 20 = 120 m2 + storage space 40 m2 + 15% = 190 m2

[**3 Library**](https://www.planning.org/pas/reports/report241.htm)
10 seats per 1k users. Community library: 217+4100 members = 43.17 seats.

20 covid proof spaces for workshop, or 50 standing = 200 m2 (20 in 200m2 is possible too, but tighter)

+/- 310 people need to enter. Let's say 4 entrances (every four cardinal direction): 310/4 = 78 people need to enter.
[+/- 30m2 per entrance](http://universaldesign.ie/Built-Environment/Building-for-Everyone/2-Entrances%20and%20Horizontal%20Circulation.pdf) 


[**7 parking**](https://www.dimensions.com/element/90-degree-parking-spaces-layouts)
+/- 22 m2 * amount of cars + entrance etc.
0.5 parking lot per apartment (80+30+100 * 0.5 = 210) = 105 spots
2310 m2 + 90 m2 entrance etc = 2400 m2 underground parking.

[**14 Co working spaces**](https://ec.europa.eu/oib/pdf/mit-standard-building-specs_en.pdf)
“The ideal architectural module of office space is 1.20 meters, but could be between 1.20 and 1.40 meters” 4*1.40 + 20% space between/routing = 6.8 m2

310 internal, 20% = 62 tenants. 
4100 externals, 20% = 820 tenants. Nearby (walking distance) gym amount: +/- 12
820/4 [ours will be 4th big one](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/779254012746530854/781827970826108958/unknown.png); there's actually more but assuming the are smaller in capacity) = +/- 205
62+205 = approx 267 people will use the gym = 10-12 square feet for each member (1.1m2). 
= 267*12 = 3204 square foot = +/= 300m2
