This is a project repository of Minor Spatial Computing 2020-2021, project group 1. The mid-term and Final submission's process, final products and underlying code/input can be found in this repository. 

Apidae is the name of a large  bee family. Bees have a mutualistic relationship with their context, live in communal hives with lots of social interaction but also have individual specific tasks related to their age. Beehives are formed in an instinctively optimized way, by creating the most efficient routes, adapting to wind orientation and other factors. 
Just like the bees, the building has a mutualistic relationship with its context, as the context is to benefit from the placement of the building and the building is a response to the context. The building is communal with the possibility of lots of social interaction, but also the possibility to seclude from the community. The people in our building help each other with specific tasks related to their age. Young people can help elderly with grocery shopping, and the elderly can help the young people with life advice. Just like the beehive, our building is formed in an optimized way. Other than the beehive, in this case it’s done with the usage of scripts.

## **_The design challenge_**

We as Project Apidae are requested to design a housing complex incorporating severalcommunal/public facilities for a cooperative live-work-playassociation at location "Rotterdam, The block betweenVijverhofstraat, Zomerhofstraat, Schoterbosstraat, and Teilingerstraat". 

The requested housing complex will be the new home of garduate students, young professionals and elderly who are in need of assisted living. The complex has to provide communal and public facilities to ensure collectivity. 

## **_Starting point_**
```html
The following program of requirements has been given:

Housing:

* Student Housing 80 units
* Assisted Living 30 units
* Starter Housing 100 units
* testing spaces


Communal spaces:

* Underground Parking (minimum of 0.5 parking lots per
* apartment)
* Vegetation (minimum 30% of the plot)
* Workshops/Fab-Labs/Co-working Space and Start-up Offices
* Library + Cinematheque + Café/Pub + (pinball) Arcade
* Co-cooking/Restaurant
* Community Centre
* Shop (grocery, tools and crafts)
* (electricity producing/odourless /geek-friendly) Gym


Also, the following design goals have been given:

* Maximum Multi-scale Modularity (Qualitative)
* Excellent Ergonomics (Qualitative)
* Keeping at least the same amount of housing units as before (Quantitative)
* Not blocking direct light for neighbour buildings (Quantitative)
* Max solar gain potential (optional, Quantitative)
* Max greenery (Quantitative)
* Min noise (Quantitative)
* Social integration (Qualitative)
* Rational spectra of privacy and community (Qualitative)
```

## **_Why Apidae?_**

This project is named Apidae --------------siebren have fun explaining

Misschien als bedrijf schrijven? van dit kunnen wij dit willen wij bereiken met project apidae etc :D

## **_Phasing_**
The documentation is divided in 4 phases:
```html
* A1_Planning: 
    Preliminary spatial analysis on the site and idea proposal 
    (KPI, Program of Requirements, Diagrams) with the starting point as input. 

* A2_Configuring:
    --------------

* A3_Massing:
    --------------
    
* A4_Forming:
    --------------
