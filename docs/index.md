## **_Why Apidae?_**

This project is named Apidae --------------siebren have fun explaining

Misschien als bedrijf schrijven? van dit kunnen wij dit willen wij bereiken met project apidae etc :D

## **_Phasing_**
The documentation is divided in 4 phases:
```html
* A1_Planning: 
    Preliminary spatial analysis on the site and idea proposal 
    (KPI, Program of Requirements, Diagrams) with the starting point as input. 

* A2_Configuring:
    --------------

* A3_Massing:
    --------------
    
* A4_Forming:
    --------------
